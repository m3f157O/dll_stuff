# dll_stuff


I made this to exercise with dll loading and injection on Windows.

- debug_dll: A dummy dll for testing
- use_dll: Program to test a specific dll
- dll_injection: Sample dll injection, by Mez0
- reflective_dll_injection: This folder contains a customized version of the original Reflective DLL implementation, which uses the original loader
